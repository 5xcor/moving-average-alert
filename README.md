### Concept
LTC has recently been the first mover in crypto rallies.  We will use LTC volume/price
change as a rally indicator and want to be notified when LTC action is unexpected.

### Development Steps
1. Decide on data source (binance/massari)
2. Pull volume & price from an exchange
  - Do we use BTC for the base pair?  Or USDT?
  - Is there any other data that we want to pull (other than volume/price) ?
3. Determine a specific time-frame to use for our data analysis
